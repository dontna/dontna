- 👋 Hi, I’m @dontna
- 👀 I’m interested in coding projects that save me time. I also make bots and automated scripts to make my life easier.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning bash scripting, before I was learning Python but now I can happily make any project I need; and if I can't I will happily learn it. Although I am always looking for ways to clean up my code so if you have any tips please let me know.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing. I do not really collaborate on stuff right now, but I'm not going to say no if the right project comes along.
- 📫 How to reach me: For all GitHub inquiries please email me at "dontnagithub@gmail.com"
